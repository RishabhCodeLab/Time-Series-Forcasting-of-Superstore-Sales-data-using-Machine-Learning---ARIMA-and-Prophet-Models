# Time Series Forecasting of Superstore-Sales data using Machine Learning - ARIMA and Prophet Models
Time series analysis is a statistical method to extract meaningful statistics and predict future values using previously observed values. It is widely used for non-stationary data like economics, weather, stock price, and retail sales. I have used ARIMA and Prophet models for forecasting Superstore Sales data.

**Data source -**
[Superstore](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls)

**To start this project, we have to install some static model libraries which help run the Prophet model, such as -**
```Python 
pip install statsmodels
pip install Cython
pip install convertdate
!pip install prophet
from prophet import Prophet
import statsmodels.api as sm
```
**We also use data analysis and data visualization libraries to get good insights into data, such as -**
```Python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import warnings
import itertools
import numpy as np
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
import pandas as pd
from pylab import rcParams
```
